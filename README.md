# YouCal

Nowadays, people concentrate on maintaining a healthy life which is needed to calculate calories in food. People prefer to find a straightforward way that is convenient for them to track calories. For example, people use the Calories Counter App or My Fitness Pal as a food tracker. These services are provided along with the user's food choices and meal planner. These applications' problems are that users must pay around $50/per year. It is costly to utilize full benefits. Moreover, the users also need calorie apps that need simple UIs, which are easy for everyone. YouCal is a desk application where users can track their calories and how much they eat in one meal.YouCal will be designed using Javascript, PHP, HTML, JS, and CSS. After registering, users will have free access to all features without limitations. People who want to stay fit and take daily calorie calculations seriously can use YouCal as an easy-to-use user interface that will allow users to find the tasks they need to complete. 

These are some functions that will be implemented in PHP on the back end:
Calorie Intake Recommendation Function: This function can recommend the number of calories a user should consume based on their goals, such as weight loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance.
Setter functions: Will contain functions that are necessary to change or update information in the database. For example, if a user is trying to make an account, we would have setAge, setWeight, setHeight, etc. that will be called whenever a user inputs information into the input fields.

These are some functions that will be implemented in JavaScript on the front end:
Input fields: Users should be able to enter their age, weight, height, gender, and level of physical activity. This frontend function communicates with the backend database to store information.
Calories calculation: This will show the calories that users need to consume each day.
Getter Functions: The frontend should have getter functions, such as getItemName or getCalorieCount, that will grab information from the database to display onto the web app.
